//! Regression tests for issue #441: rules whose keyword was missing from the
//! pack's `PACK_ENTRIES` row could never fire.
//!
//! Each pack declares its keywords twice, and the two lists gate in sequence:
//! `PACK_ENTRIES` builds the `EnabledKeywordIndex` that decides whether a pack is
//! a candidate at all, and only then does `Pack::might_match` consult the pack's
//! own `keywords`. A keyword added to the pack list and not to the registry row
//! is therefore dead — the command is quick-rejected before the pack is
//! considered, and it is allowed with no rule named.
//!
//! `system.services` and `package_managers` were almost entirely non-functional
//! for their headline rules: `shutdown -h now`, `reboot`, `init 0`,
//! `apt purge --autoremove`, `yum remove -y`, `brew uninstall --force`,
//! `poetry publish`, `mvn deploy` and `gradle publish` were all allowed.
//!
//! These assertions go through the real binary, so the registry gate is in the
//! path. Pack-level tests could not catch this: they call `Pack::check` directly
//! and never pass through it.
