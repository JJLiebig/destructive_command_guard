//! Home-subtree move deadlock: two `core.filesystem` rules each recommend the
//! command the other denies.
//!
//! Reported shape (ordinary personal file organisation under `~/Documents`):
//!
//! 1. `mv "~/Documents/Personal/Admin/<dir>" "~/Documents/_archived/"` is
//!    denied by `mv-sensitive-source-root-home`, whose guidance recommends
//!    "copy, verify, then delete the source".
//! 2. That recursive delete of the source is denied by `rm-rf-root-home`,
//!    whose guidance recommends relocating the tree to
//!    `/tmp/delete-me-<timestamp>`.
//! 3. That relocation is denied by `mv-sensitive-source-root-home` again.
//!
//! Every sanctioned escape is blocked by the other rule, so no verified
//! move-then-cleanup completes inside a home directory and plain renames need
//! a per-command `dcg allow-once`.
//!
//! Two independent causes, pinned separately below.
//!
//! **Cause 1 — no rescue for a rename that never leaves the home tree.** The
//! rule's own bypass story is cross-segment relocate-then-delete. A move whose
//! source and destination are both at least two components below the same
//! home-root form cannot be that: nothing leaves the tree, and a later
//! recursive delete of the destination is denied exactly as before.
//! `mv-within-home` rescues that class only.
//!
//! **Cause 2 — the rescues are quote-blind while the denial is not.** The
//! destructive path alternation is prefixed with `['"\\]?`, so it sees through
//! quotes; every safe pattern that could rescue a home path reads bare words
//! only. Quoting therefore only ever moves a command toward deny — and a
//! filename containing a space MUST be quoted. `mv <path> ~/.Trash/` (the
//! soft-delete dcg itself recommends) is allowed unquoted and denied the
//! moment the path contains a space. `mv-to-trash-quoted` closes that.
//!
//! The `#316` suggestion self-consistency test did not catch this: it
//! evaluates `PatternSuggestion` commands, and both dead-end recommendations
//! live in the rules' prose `explanation` text, which nothing evaluates. The
//! guidance cases below pin those prose commands directly.
