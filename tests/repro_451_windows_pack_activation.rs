//! Regression tests for #451's activation half: a Windows payload arriving on a
//! non-Windows host must actually turn the `windows.*` packs on.
//!
//! `windows_payload` in `main.rs` matched `ShellDialect::PowerShell | Cmd`, but
//! `hook::refine_shell_dialect` down-trusts a *mislabeled* `Bash` payload to
//! `Unknown` — never to either of those. That mislabeled case is the #322/#252
//! case, and it is the one #451 exists for, so on Linux/macOS the packs never
//! activated for it and rules that deny when the packs are named were allowed.
//!
//! `format D: /q` is the sharpest instance, because the repair had already been
//! written and could not work: `hook::segment_is_format_drive_invocation` was
//! added *specifically* so that command would reach
//! `windows.filesystem:format-drive`, and the `Unknown` it widens to could not
//! activate the pack it was widening for.
//!
//! These assertions run the real binary under the DEFAULT configuration — no
//! `DCG_PACKS` — because that is the only way to exercise activation. A test
//! that names the pack proves the rule exists, which was never in doubt; it
//! cannot prove the pack turns on by itself.
