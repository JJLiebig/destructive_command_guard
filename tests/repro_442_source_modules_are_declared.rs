//! #442 guard: every top-level `src/*.rs` must be reachable from the module tree.
//!
//! Rust does not auto-discover modules. A file sitting under `src/` with no
//! `mod` declaration is not part of the crate at all: it is never compiled,
//! never linted, and any `#[test]` function inside it never runs.
//!
//! `src/scanner_regression_tests.rs` shipped in exactly that state. Its
//! declaration lived only in `vendor/patches/dcg-bash-scanner-wiring.patch`, so
//! on `main` the file was inert. That went unnoticed because
//! `cargo test --lib <filter>` exits 0 when the filter matches nothing — so the
//! `scanner-safety` workflow step named "Compile and run the actual ast-grep
//! regressions" passed while running zero tests, and every heavy step gated on
//! its success ran on the strength of that vacuous pass.
//!
//! This guard lives under `tests/` deliberately: Cargo discovers every file in
//! that directory automatically, so the guard itself cannot be orphaned the same
//! way the thing it guards was. Both halves of it are covered below — the
//! matcher and the orphan detection are exercised against synthetic inputs, so a
//! guard that silently stopped detecting anything would fail rather than pass.
