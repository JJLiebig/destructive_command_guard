//! Semantic classifier behind `core.filesystem:credential-file-write`.
//!
//! The rule denies any command that WRITES a credential, private-key,
//! login-shell startup, or system authentication file, whether or not the
//! file exists yet: every truncating or appending redirect spelling, `tee` and
//! `sponge`, `cp`/`mv`/`install`/`ln` onto the path or into its directory,
//! `dd of=`, and `sed -i`/`perl -i`. Reads, `chmod`/`chown`, `ssh-keygen`,
//! and appending to `~/.ssh/known_hosts` (what `ssh` itself does) are
//! untouched.
//!
//! It is a classifier rather than a regex because the answer depends on the
//! path the shell will actually hand to `open()`: quote removal, backslash
//! escapes, brace expansion, globs, `$HOME`/`~user` forms, and `..` all change
//! it. Each target word is decoded with the shell's own quoting rules into
//! text plus a per-character "literal" flag, using the whitelist introduced
//! for the #390 carve-out (ce11b48): a character is literal when it was quoted
//! or escaped, is non-ASCII, or is one of the bare characters no supported
//! shell rewrites. A spelling that is not literal to the end cannot be proven
//! harmless, so it is denied whenever its literal prefix can still complete
//! into a protected path (`~/.zshr{c..c}`, `~/.ssh/id_*`, `~/{.zshrc,x}`) and
//! ignored when it cannot (`~/notes-{a,b}.txt`).
//!
//! PowerShell and Cmd payloads are read by [`windows_shells`], which decodes
//! their words into the same [`Word`] model so every path decision below is
//! shared rather than re-implemented per dialect (#477).
