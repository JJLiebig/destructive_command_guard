//! Azure DevOps CLI patterns — the `azure-devops` Azure CLI extension.
//!
//! Scope (issue #385): the command groups the `azure-devops` extension adds to
//! `az` — `az devops`, `az repos`, `az pipelines`, `az boards` and
//! `az artifacts`. The extension installs itself the first time one of those
//! commands runs, so its surface is present on any workstation that has `az`.
//!
//! This is deliberately a separate pack from `cloud.azure`: that pack guards
//! Azure *resources* (subscriptions, VMs, storage, Key Vault), while these
//! commands act on an Azure DevOps *organization* (projects, repositories,
//! pipelines, boards, permissions). They are enabled independently.
//!
//! Coverage boundary, stated so it can be checked against the reference:
//!
//! - Only **GA** commands are modelled. The `az devops migrations *` group is
//!   Preview and its verbs (`abandon`, `pause`, `pipelines delete`) are
//!   deliberately not rules yet — the group is still changing shape.
//! - `az artifacts` has **no** destructive command: the whole documented group
//!   is `az artifacts universal download` and `az artifacts universal publish`.
//!   Nothing to guard, and no rule pretends otherwise.
//! - `az devops invoke` can issue an arbitrary Azure DevOps REST call, so it is
//!   matched on its `--http-method` rather than on a resource verb.
//! - Read-only verbs (`list`, `show`, `list-*`, `search`) and ordinary
//!   development flow (`az repos pr create`, `az pipelines run`,
//!   `az boards work-item create`) carry no rule and are allowed by default.
//!
