//! AST-based pattern matching for heredoc and inline script content.
//!
//! This module implements Tier 3 of the heredoc detection architecture,
//! using ast-grep-core for structural pattern matching.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! Content + Language
//!      │
//!      ▼
//! ┌─────────────────┐
//! │   AstMatcher    │ ─── Parse error ──► ERROR to bounded fallback
//! │   (ast-grep)    │ ─── Timeout ──► ERROR to bounded fallback
//! │   <5ms typical  │ ─── No match ──► EMPTY result to evaluator
//! │   20ms max      │ ─── Match ──► MATCH result to evaluator
//! └─────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! # Error Handling
//!
//! All errors are returned to the evaluator, which applies the configured
//! bounded-fallback or strict-block policy:
//! - Parse errors: Language syntax not recognized
//! - Timeouts: Pattern matching exceeded time budget
//! - Unknown language: No grammar available
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! - Pattern compilation: One-time at startup
//! - Parse: <2ms for typical heredoc sizes
//! - Match: <1ms typical
//! - Hard timeout: 20ms

///    just `rm_r` with `force: true`; the only difference is that `rm_rf`
///    swallows errors, so `rm_r` is what a script that checks for failure uses.
